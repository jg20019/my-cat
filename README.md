This project is an implementation of cat in Common Lisp. 

## Depenedencies
* sbcl
* quicklisp

## Quickstart
Clone this repository where quicklisp can find it. Run `$ make my-cat`
to build the code and run `$ ./my-cat` to run it. 

Currently only printing numbers for blank or non-blank lines,
squeezing blank lines and showing the ends of a line are the only options
supported.
